# json_light
simple json parser c++

After trying several existing I decided to try to create one more. Something as simple in using and extending as I can.
It took a pair evenings of hard work, and it is not finished, but can be already used for parsing json strings and get some values from it.
I'm not sure I'll keep up the interest in this case, so I decided to put the already existing code in the public domain so that it doesn't get lost. Maybe someone will be interested and make use of it.

I will try to upload the code next days.
